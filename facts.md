# Facts About Amazon
This is a markdown file with an in depth history of many morally wrong practices at Amazon. This list is very much not complete, and at the end I have included my sources.

Some of these sentences are going to sound very similar to those found on [Amazon's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), as that is because it is where I found the sources and information for much of this.

## Controversies

### Environmental Impact:
In 2018, 44.4 million tons of CO2 we're emitted by amazon.<sup>[1]</sup> As part of the Global Climate strike, over 1,800 employees in 14 countries walked out in September 2019 to protest the impact and lack of action taken against climate change.<sup>[2]</sup> These workers also petitioned the company and it's now ex-CEO (Jeff "Knockoff-and-Shittier Dr. Evil" Bezos) to stop donating to politicians and lobbyists who deny the existance of climate change, to stop working with fossil fuel companies in accelerating oil extraction from the earth, and to be carbon-zero by 2030.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup>

While amazon has introduced Shipment Zero to have 50% of all amazon shipments to be carbon neutral by 2030, but it only covers 50% of shipments and the overall carbon emissions by Amazon will most likely grow overall due to Amazon's growth in general.<sup>[5]</sup>

Jeff "Knockoff-and-Shittier Dr. Evil" Bezos has also pledged to be carbon zero by 2040, but that is still almost 20 years away at this point.<sup>[6]</sup>

As a contradiction to Amazon's pledges to fight climate, they also fund climate change denial groups and politicians such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Jim Inhofe.<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup>

### Counterfeit, Unsafe and Discarded Items
Amazon has been known to sell and ship counterfeight items, from both third-party fulfillers and their own warehouses.<sup>[9]</sup> Some of these counterfeight products have been found to be fire hazards, espescially ones marketed to be Apple Chargers.<sup>[10]</sup><sup>[11]</sup> One other thing to note is that the existance of these items isn't simply tied to high ticket items, but small and cheap ones as well.<sup>[12][13][14]</sup> Last, but certainly not least, some of these counterfeight items were copies of items from small businesses and artists without their permission at a large scale.<sup>[15]</sup> 

In terms of unsafe and low quality items, many of the "Amazon's Choice" are low quality, have many customer complaints, and are also deemed to be the subject of review manipulation as Buzfeed reported in June of 2019.<sup>[16]</sup>

In August 2019, The Wall Street Journal, found more than 4,000 items which had either been banned by federal regulators, were declared unsafe by federal agencies, and/or had misleading labels.<sup>[17]</sup>

Following the Buzzfeed and WSJ reports, letters were sent to Bezos regarding the counterfeight items (U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Bob Mendex) and the unsafe items (aforementioned Senators along with U.S. Senator Ed Markey) in September of 2019.<sup>[17]</sup><sup>[18]</sup> 

Later that year, the WSJ also reported on the occurance and ease of selling items retrieved from dumpsters and reporting them as being new. Additionally, these items we're being obtained from clearance sections, thrift stores, and pawn shops by sellers to use as stock.<sup>[19]</sup><sup>[20]</sup>

Due to a replacement battery bought by a Californian off of Amazon giving her 3rd degree burns, an appeals court in California ruled Amazon could be held accountable for unsafe products sold on the site.<sup>[21]</sup>

### Tax Avoidance
In 2019, Fair Tax Mark repoprted that Amazon's effective tax rate between 2010 and 2018 was only 12% accross China, Germany, Poland, South Korea, France, Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, the UK, the US, and Portugal.<sup>[22]</sup><sup>[23]</sup> Amazon refuted this by saying they paid an effective tax rate of 24% during this time period, though this still heavily contrasts the 35% tax rate in the US, the country which made up approximately 68% of their sales in 2018.<sup>[23]</sup><sup>[24]</sup>

### Trade Union Opposition
In both the US and UK, Amazon has opposed and prevented efforts to unionize. After a union drive in 2001, 850 employees were layed off, which subsequently caused the Washington Alliance of Technological Workers to accuse the company of violating union laws. Even though the Union claimed Amazon managers subjected employees to intimidation and heavy propoganda, Amazon denied any link between the employees being fired and their unionization efforts.<sup>[25]</sup>

In 2001, Amazon UK hired a management consultant from the US, The Burke Group, to assist in defeating the unionization efforts of the Graphical, Paper, and Media Union in their Milton Keynes distribution depot.<sup>[26]</sup>

In 2018, internal training videos revealed that Amazon's stance was "not anti-union, but not neutral", as they believe unions aren't in the best interest for their share-holders or associates.<sup>[27]</sup>

Two years later in 2020, leaked internal documents we're leaked revealing that at over 510 locations, Amazon's grocery store chain Whole Foods had tracked the likelyhood of each location to unionize. They took in factors such as racial and ethnic diversity, how poor the situated community was, proximity to other unions to determine what they called a "unionization risk".<sup>[28]</sup><sup>[29]</sup><sup>[30]</sup>

During the Bessemer, Alabama unionization efforts in April of 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Amazon illegally fired two employees trying to organize.<sup>[31]</sup> Additionally, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union asked for a hearing from the NLRB about whether Amazon created "an atmosphere of confusion, coercion, and/or fear of repraisals."<sup>[32]</sup>

### Working Conditions
The number of working conditions controversies Amazon has faced in the recent years is so great, it is only proper to put them on a numbered list. The section on Wikipedia is easily two to three times the size of the previous sections. Coming from former employees, current employees, politicians, and the media, working condition criticism has been, but is certainly not limited to the following:

1. In 2011, workers at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse were forced to work in 100 degree farenheight (38 degree celcius) temperatures, causing employee discomfort, dehydration, and for some to even collapse. Additionally, loading bay doors were not allowed to be opened for fear of package theft.<sup>[33]</sup> As it was apparently cheaper, Amazon proceeded to keep an Ambulance stationed at the warehouse to take employees to the hospital in the case of a medical emergency.<sup>[33]</sup> Eventually, the company added air conditioning to the warehouse.<sup>[34]</sup>


2. Pickers walk up to 15 miles (24km) in a shift, with their scanners tracking every movement and timing of theirs. Being too slow or standing around for too long also causes employees to be reprimanded by Team Leads and Area Managers.<sup>[35]</sup><sup>[36]</sup>


3. In February of 2013, a German television channel reported that an Amazon distribution center in Bad Hersfeld had hired a security company which in turn had employed Neo-Nazis at the location. The report noted these members had Neo-Nazi backgrounds and/or deliberately dressed in Neo-Nazi apparel and were intimidating both foreign and temporary female workers. After the report aired, Amazon cut ties with the security company.<sup>[37]</sup><sup>[38]</sup><sup>[39]</sup><sup>[40]</sup>


4. In March of 2015, The Verge reported that Amazon would finally be removing the non-compete clause from their contracts. This clause would prevent employees, even temporary ones, from "directly or indirectly" supporting a competitor of Amazon. This had prevented many employees from finding work after leaving, being fired, or made redundant.<sup>[41]</sup><sup>[42]</sup>


5. In 2015, a front page article from the New York Times interviewed multiple former Amazon employees<sup>[43]</sup>, who described the working environment as "bruising" where workers with illness or personal crises were forced out or unfairly evaluated.<sup>[45]</sup> In response, Bald Man disputed the Times' report and stated that the actions described would never be tolerated at Amazon.<sup>[44]</sup><sup>[45]</sup>


6. In mid-2018, investigations from multiple journalists and media outlests reported poor working conditions in Amazon's warehouses.<sup>[46]</sup><sup>[47]</sup> Later that year, another article exposed the poor working conditions of Amazon's delivery drivers.<sup>[48]</sup>


7. On black friday in 2018, Amazon warehouse workers in Italy, Germany, Spain, and the UK went on strike to protest inhumane working conditions and low pay.<sup>[49]</sup> 


8. Reported by the Daily Beast in March of 2019, there were 189 calls from 46 Amazon warehouses in 17 states in the US between 2013 and 2018, all being related to suicidal employees. These workers attributed their suicidal tendencies to social isolation, aggressive surveillance, and the dangerous working conditions caused by Amazon and it's warehouses. One of these employees said, "It's this isolating colony of hell where people having breakdowns is a regular occurrence."<sup>[50]</sup>


9. During the onset of Amazon's Prime Day in 2019, employees from the US and Germany went on strike to protest the poor working conditions and unfair wages.<sup>[51]</sup><sup>[52]</sup>


10. During the COVID-19 outbreak in March of 2020, Amazon UK had reportedly put profit over safety according to the GMB.<sup>[53]</sup> The Union later called for the UK government and safety regulators to take action against Amazon's gruelling conditions, unrealistic productivity targets, surveillance, bogus self-employement, and refusing to interact with unions unless forced.<sup>[54]</sup>


11. The BBC reported on Amazon's Twitter ambassadors in August of 2019. The constanst support for and defense of Amazon actually led many to believe they were actually bots being used to dismiss issues affecting Amazon workers.<sup>[55]</sup> In March of 2021, many new ambassador accounts claiming to be employees were made to defend the company against a union drive in Alabama. Amazon confirmed at least one was fake and Twitter shut down several for violations of it's terms of use.<sup>[56]</sup>


12. On November 27 of 2020, Amnesty International Amazon workers had faced great health and safety risks through the pandemic. During one of Amazon's busiest periods on Black Friday, the company failed to ensure proper safety in France, Poland, the UK, and the US. Ironically, these risks were undertaken by employees to ensure essential goods were delivered to customer doorsteps, which helped Amazon achieve record profits.<sup>[57]</sup>


13. Drivers have alleged they would need to urinate and defecate in their vans to meet quotas instead of using proper restrooms. The official Amazon News account refuted these claims by saying "You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us." Shortly thereafter, Amazon employees leaken an email to the Intercept showing that they were aware of how the drivers used the restroom.<sup>[58]</sup> Amazon acknowledged the issue after initially denying it.<sup>[59]</sup>


14. In July of 2021, workers from the New York City warehouse file a complaint with OSHA describing 12 hour workdays with sweltering temperatures which resulted in fainting and workers bein carried out on stretchers. The complaint reads, "internal temperature is too hot. We have no ventilation, dusty, dirty fans that spread debris into our lungs and eyes, are working at a non-stop pace and [we] are fainting out from heat exhaustion, getting nose bleeds from high blood pressure and feeling dizzy and nauseous." The complaint also described non-functional fans, water fountains without water, and insufficient cooling systems. The complaint was filed by those affiliated with the Amazon Labor Union group, who are also trying to unionize the facility. Similar reports came up during the 2021 heat wave in locations such as Kent, Washington.<sup>[60]</sup><sup>[61]</sup>
