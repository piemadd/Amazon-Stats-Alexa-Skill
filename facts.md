# Facts About Amazon
This is a markdown file with an in depth history of many morally wrong practices at Amazon. This list is very much not complete, and at the end I have included my sources.

## Controversies

### Environmental Impact:
In 2018, 44.4 million tons of CO2 we're emitted by amazon.<sup>[1]</sup> As part of the Global Climate strike, over 1,800 employees in 14 countries walked out in September 2019 to protest the impact and lack of action taken against climate change[2]. These workers also petitioned the company and it's now ex-CEO (Jeff "Knockoff-and-Shittier Dr. Evil" Bezos) to stop donating to politicians and lobbyists who deny the existance of climate change, to stop working with fossil fuel companies in accelerating oil extraction from the earth, and to be carbon-zero by 2030.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup>
